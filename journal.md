well a lot of businesses small ones especially used that app allot to promote there things so id imagine it had one heck of an impact or maybe not at all who knows, but then again if the app would have been banned indefinitly it would have somehwat been fine because people there is more than just tiktok, well id feel bad because theyd have to build up the following and recognition once more, the nex question is a hard one i didnt een no really cared that tiktok had security problems thats due to the whole fact that up to the point whe banned i didnt have nor used tiktok like that when i had it, thought it was pointless, plus im more of an instagram reels person, i would o, plement better security for all users, doesnt seem simple but if thats what people are worried about then fix it or address the problem mishap, i cant leave people in the dark, anyways its more easily said than done, nothing really i can take from it because like i said it did me nor did i really give a hoot, but i guess if i could take something from this event, just stay safe when being online is all, theres nothir too it than that really if you thin about it.
